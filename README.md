[Mainly data cleaning] My take on Dq's Python intermediate and Pandas Guided Project on employees exit survey data.

EN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main focus of this project is data cleaning. I am working with two datasets

    exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)
    exit surveys from employees of the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.
    
These datasets are going to be joined during this process

The following question are going to be examined:

    Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

    Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
